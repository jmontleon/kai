### Reasoning:
The issue found from static code analysis of the Java EE code which needs to be fixed to migrate to Quarkus is: "Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used. Please replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`."
### Updated file 1
src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/mdb/HelloWorldQueueMDB.java:import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

   @Incoming("CMTQueue")
   public void onMessage(String msg) {
       Log.info("Received Message: " + msg);
   }
}
