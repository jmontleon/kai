## Reasoning

### Step 1:

The first step is to identify the issue that needs to be addressed. In this case, the issue is that Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead.

### Step 2:

The next step is to understand the problem. In this case, the problem is that the code is using EJBs, which are not supported in Quarkus.

### Step 3:

The next step is to identify the solution. In this case, the solution is to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

### Step 4:

The next step is to implement the solution. In this case, the solution is to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

### Step 5:

The next step is to test the solution. In this case, the solution can be tested by running the code and verifying that it works as expected.

### Step 6:

The next step is to document the solution. In this case, the solution can be documented by adding comments to the code explaining the changes that were made.

### Step 7:

The next step is to review the solution. In this case, the solution can be reviewed by a colleague or by running the code again to verify that it still works as expected.

### Step 8:

The next step is to deploy the solution. In this case, the solution can be deployed by building the code and deploying it to a Quarkus server.

### Step 9:

The next step is to monitor the solution. In this case, the solution can be monitored by using Quarkus' built-in monitoring tools to verify that the code is running as expected.

### Step 10:

The next step is to maintain the solution. In this case, the solution can be maintained by regularly updating the code to ensure that it continues to work as expected.

```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldMDB {

   @Incoming("CMTQueue")
   public void onMessage(String msg) {
       Log.info("Received Message: " + msg);
   }
