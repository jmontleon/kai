## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus does not support Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs).

2. Next, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` package imports with Quarkus/CDI equivalents.

3. We also need to replace the `javax.jms` package imports with Quarkus/SmallRye Reactive Messaging API imports.

4. Since we are using SmallRye Reactive Messaging API, we need to replace the `Message` and `MessageListener` interfaces with a method that uses the `@Incoming` annotation to receive messages.

5. We also need to replace the `javax.jms.TextMessage` with `String` as the message type.

6. We will replace the `javax.util.logging.Logger` with `io.quarkus.logging.Log` for logging.

7. We will replace the `javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty` and `@MessageDriven` annotations with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation.

8. We will replace the `destinationLookup` property with the `CMTQueue` name.

9. We will replace the `destinationType` property with the `javax.jms.Queue` type.

10. We will replace the `acknowledgeMode` property with the `@Incoming` annotation's parameter.

    private static final Log LOGGER = Log.getLogger(HelloWorldQueueMDB.class.getName());

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {

    }
}
```

Note: The above updated file uses the `Log` class from the `io.quarkus.logging` package instead of the `javax.util.logging.Logger` class. Also, the `@MessageDriven` annotation is replaced with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, and the `javax.jms.Message` and `javax.jms.MessageListener` interfaces are replaced with a method that uses the `@Incoming` annotation to receive messages. The `javax.jms.TextMessage` type is replaced with `String` as the message type. The `javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty` annotations are removed, and the `destinationLookup`, `destinationType`, and `acknowledgeMode` properties are replaced with the `@Incoming` annotation's parameter.
