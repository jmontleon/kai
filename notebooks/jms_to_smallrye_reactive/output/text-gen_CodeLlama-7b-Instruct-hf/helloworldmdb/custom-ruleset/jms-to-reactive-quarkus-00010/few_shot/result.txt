## Reasoning

To migrate this Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

Here's the reasoning for each step:

1. Replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.

This is because Quarkus does not support EJBs, so we need to use CDI instead. `@ApplicationScoped` is a CDI scope annotation that ensures that the bean is created once and shared across all requests.

2. Remove the `javax.jms.Queue` import and add the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Incoming` import.

This is because Quarkus provides a reactive messaging API that we can use instead of the JMS API. We need to remove the `javax.jms.Queue` import because it is not supported in Quarkus, and add the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Incoming` import to use the reactive messaging API.

3. Replace the `MessageListener` interface with the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Message` interface.

This is because the `MessageListener` interface is not supported in Quarkus, and we need to use the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Message` interface instead.

4. Remove the `onMessage` method and add a `onMessage` method that takes a `String` parameter.

This is because the `onMessage` method in the original code takes a `Message` parameter, but we need to change it to take a `String` parameter because the `io.quarkus.reactive.messaging.Message` interface only provides a `String` payload.

5. Remove the `LOGGER` field and add a `Log` field.

This is because Quarkus provides a logging API that we can use instead of the `java.util.logging.Logger` class. We need to remove the `LOGGER` field because it is not supported in Quarkus, and add the `Log` field to use the logging API.

6. Remove the `LOGGER.info` and `LOGGER.warning` statements and add `Log.info` and `Log.warning` statements.

This is because Quarkus provides a logging API that we can use instead of the `java.util.logging.Logger` class. We need to remove the `LOGGER.info` and `LOGGER.warning` statements because they are not supported in Quarkus, and add the `Log.info` and `Log.warning` statements to use the logging API.
