### Reasoning

1. The first step is to identify the issue with the code. The issue is that the code uses Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) which are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used instead.
2. The next step is to look at the solved example to see how a similar issue was addressed. The solved example shows that the `@MessageDriven` annotation was replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. The next step is to apply the same solution to the input file. The `@MessageDriven` annotation is replaced with `@ApplicationScoped`.
4. The next step is to look at the imports to see if any changes are needed. The import for `javax.ejb.MessageDriven` is removed and the import for `io.quarkus.logging.Log` is added.
5. The next step is to look at the pom.xml to see if any changes are needed. The dependency for `org.jboss.spec.javax.ejb:jboss-ejb-api_3.2_spec` is removed and the dependency for `io.quarkus:quarkus-arc` is added.
6. The next step is to look at the code to see if any changes are needed. The `onMessage` method is updated to use the `Log` class instead of the `Logger` class.
