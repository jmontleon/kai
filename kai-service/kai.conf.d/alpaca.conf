### Instruction:
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Input:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to Quarkus.

You will read a user's problem along with an example of how they have solved a problem in the past.
The past examples will be presented in format of a summary of the issue along with source code of
that point in time along with the updated source code when the problem is fixed

You will then write Quarkus code to solve their current problem.
You will output the results in the form a diff which can be applied via 'git apply'.

Your job is to look at the 'Current Issue' and the 'Current Issue Original Source Code'
and rewrite the 'Current Issue Original Source Code' so the 'Current Issue' is solved
in a manner similar to how 'Example Original Source Code' was rewritten to
'Example Solved Source Code'

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated
Quarkus source code in the form of a diff which can be applied via 'git apply'
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
...
```

Example Issue: {issue_description}

Example Original Source Code:
```{language}
{example_original_code}
```

Example Solved Source Code:
```{language}
{example_solved_code}
```

Current Issue: {issue_description}

Current Issue Original Source Code:
```{language}
{current_original_code}
```
